# neopets-login
[Stackpath](https://www.stackpath.com/) security makes grabbing session cookies from [Neopets](http://www.neopets.com/) fairly difficult with networking API's alone. This repository contains a working solution that uses [puppeteer-firefox](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/tree/master/experimental/puppeteer-firefox) to perform the login.

# Testing
Update package.json with your own Neopets credentials and run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run test
```
